# Bridge Operations

The Mavrk Bridge system enables seamless cross-chain asset transfers between major blockchain networks and Ink L2. Built on the Relay Protocol, it provides secure, efficient, and cost-effective bridging for ETH and other supported assets.

## Overview

The Bridge system allows users to:

- **Transfer ETH** from major chains to Ink L2
- **Bridge assets** between Ethereum, Base, Polygon, and other supported networks
- **Real-time balance tracking** with automatic network switching
- **Percentage-based inputs** for quick amount selection
- **Transaction monitoring** with direct explorer links

## Supported Networks

### 🌐 **Source Chains (Where you bridge FROM)**
- **Ethereum Mainnet** (Chain ID: 1)
- **Base Mainnet** (Chain ID: 8453)
- **Polygon** (Chain ID: 137)

## How to Use the Bridge

### 1. Access the Bridge

1. Navigate to the **"Bridge & Swap"** section
2. Click the **"Bridge"** tab (default view)
3. The bridge interface will load with network selection

### 2. Select Source Chain

1. **Click the dropdown** next to "From" 
2. **Choose your source chain** (e.g., Ethereum, Base, Polygon)
3. **Wallet will automatically switch** to the selected network
4. **Balance will update** to show your ETH balance on that chain

### 3. Set Bridge Amount

#### Percentage Buttons
- **25%**: Bridge 25% of your balance
- **50%**: Bridge 50% of your balance  
- **75%**: Bridge 75% of your balance
- **Max**: Bridge 95% of your balance (5% reserved for gas)

#### Manual Input
- **Enter amount** directly in the input field
- **Real-time validation** ensures you don't exceed balance
- **Gas estimation** shows estimated fees

### 4. Review and Bridge

1. **Review details**:
   - Source chain and amount
   - Destination chain (Ink L2)
   - Estimated fees and time
   - Exchange rate

2. **Click "Bridge"**
3. **Confirm transaction** in your wallet
4. **Wait for confirmation** (typically 1-3 minutes)

### 5. Monitor Progress

1. **Transaction Hash**: Click to view on source chain explorer
2. **Request ID**: Click to monitor on Relay Protocol
3. **Status Updates**: Real-time progress tracking
4. **Completion**: Notification when bridge completes

## Bridge Process Details

### Step 1: Transaction Initiation
- **User initiates** bridge transaction on source chain
- **Relay Protocol** processes the request
- **Request ID** generated for tracking
- **Transaction confirmed** on source chain

### Step 2: Cross-Chain Processing
- **Relay validators** verify the transaction
- **Cross-chain message** sent to destination
- **Ink L2** receives the bridge request
- **Validation** occurs on destination chain

### Step 3: Asset Delivery
- **ETH minted** on Ink L2 (if bridging ETH)
- **Tokens transferred** to user's Ink L2 address
- **Bridge completion** confirmed
- **User receives** bridged assets

## Network Switching

### Automatic Switching
- **Wallet Integration**: Automatically switches your wallet to the selected chain
- **Balance Updates**: Real-time balance fetching for each network
- **RPC Optimization**: Uses reliable RPC endpoints for each chain
- **Error Handling**: Fallback mechanisms for failed switches

### Manual Verification
- **Check Network**: Verify your wallet is on the correct chain
- **Balance Confirmation**: Ensure you have sufficient balance
- **Gas Estimation**: Check gas fees before bridging
- **Transaction History**: Review previous bridge transactions

## Fee Structure

### Bridge Fees
- **Relay Protocol Fees**: Varies by network and amount
- **Gas Costs**: Source chain transaction fees
- **Exchange Rates**: Real-time rate calculations
- **Total Cost**: Transparent fee breakdown

### Cost Optimization
- **Batch Bridging**: Bridge larger amounts to reduce per-transaction costs
- **Network Selection**: Choose networks with lower gas fees
- **Timing**: Bridge during low-congestion periods
- **Amount Planning**: Use percentage buttons for optimal amounts

## Supported Assets

### Currently Supported
- **ETH**: Native Ethereum on all supported chains
- **WETH**: Wrapped Ethereum (automatically handled)
- **More assets coming soon**

### Future Support
- **ERC-20 Tokens**: Major tokens on each chain
- **Stablecoins**: USDC, USDT, DAI
- **Popular Tokens**: Chain-specific popular tokens

## Security Features

- **Decentralized Validators**: Multiple validator nodes
- **Cryptographic Proofs**: Secure cross-chain verification
- **Audit History**: Regularly audited protocol
- **Battle-Tested**: Proven in production

### 🛡️ **Platform Security**
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive validation of all inputs
- **Balance Verification**: Real-time balance checking
- **Transaction Monitoring**: Track all bridge operations
- **Error Handling**: Graceful failure management

### 🔍 **Transparency**
- **Open Source**: All code is publicly available
- **Explorer Links**: Direct links to all transactions
- **Real-Time Status**: Live progress tracking
- **Audit Reports**: Public security audits

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Insufficient balance"**
- Check you have enough ETH on the source chain
- Verify you're on the correct network
- Account for gas fees in your calculation

**"Network switch failed"**
- Manually switch your wallet to the correct chain
- Refresh the page and try again
- Check your wallet's network settings

**"Transaction pending"**
- Wait for confirmation on the source chain
- Check the transaction hash on the explorer
- Monitor the Relay Protocol status

**"Bridge timeout"**
- Check the Relay Protocol status page
- Contact support if issue persists
- Verify the destination address is correct
