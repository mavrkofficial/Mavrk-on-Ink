About Ink
Ink is an Ethereum OP Stack layer 2 blockchain designed to be the house of DeFi for the Superchain; a powerful baselayer for deploying innovative DeFi protocols.

Built on the Superchain and unleashed by Kraken, Ink will serve as a central point in your journey towards onchain financial sovereignty.

Ink features:

Abstraction: Ink integrates Kraken’s infrastructure and enables users to enjoy a unified experience from converting fiat to the cutting edge of DeFi.

DeFi-first: Ink aims to scale up DeFi’s user base and evolve the quality and range of DeFi products.

UX: Ink pursues a user experience that makes your onchain journey a breeze by leveraging aggregation, automation and abstraction. Check out our Ink Kit here for more.

Speed: 1s block times on day one with subsecond block times coming soon.

Security: Kraken’s decade-long record of security and reliability will be reflected and pushed forward on Ink.

Support: Builders can expect rich documentation, expert guidance, workshops, tailored onboarding, dedicated community channels and financial support to bring their ideas to life.

Low Fees: Harnessing the scalability of Optimism and the security of Ethereum, gas fees on Ink are a fraction of mainnet.

Open Source, Scaling Ethereum: At Ink, we build in the open, benefiting all.

EVM compatible: Seamlessly deploy any Solidity contract written for Ethereum Mainnet or other L2s directly on Ink without modifications.

**Proposal Stakeholders**
Proposer: Ink
Deployer: Protofire
Frontend: Reservoir (launching soon)
Bridge Provider: Canonical
Target Chain: Ink

**Deployment Details**
As is the case with all official v3 deployments, this deployment is governed by the Uniswap DAO via Ink’s native bridge. The factory is owned by the CrossChainAccount contract, which forwards messages from the UNI Timelock contract on Ethereum. Per the governance process, the UAC will review the deployment and update the text record to include the Ink deployment.
